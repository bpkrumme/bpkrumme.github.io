## It's been a couple of months...

I was working hard on the Ansible + Terraform series...and was almost ready to complete part 3 (which is still coming, btw!), but life reared its ugly head and presented me with some challenges I couldn't ignore.

To summarize, in the time between my last post and now, I've suffered multiple personal losses.  I won't go into too many details as I like to keep my personal private, however I've been to too many funerals over the last two months.  Additionally, the next 6+ months are going to be filled with extra tasks needing done...outside of my normal day to day.

What this means is posts are going to be less frequent.  I will try for one a month, just to keep things fresh.

Part 3 of the Ansible+Terraform series is coming...with an ETA of Christmas Day.

Stay tuned...
