## Making visual improvements

You'll notice that I keep making visual changes to the site.  As I find improvements or add pages, they will seem to just magically appear as I make commits to the repo.  As I continue to tweak and adjust I'm sure the visual modifications will slow down, but for now consider the look and feel a work in progress.

### What's coming next

My next actual post will be on my homelab and the configuration of both hardware and software I use on a daily basis to create custom demos and try new things.  This one is going to take a while and possibly be a multi-part read.

Stay tuned...
