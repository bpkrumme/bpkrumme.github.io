## *Slight snafu...easy fix!*

I made a little boo-boo and used a domain name and blog name that I shouldn't have.  All is well and I've updated the site to something a little more generic, but still suits me.

### *What's coming on the site*

I have some topics that I'll be covering in upcoming posts and want to share them with everyone.  Here's what you can expect to see over the next few months...

* An overview of my homelab including the hardware and software I use
* How-tos for multiple integrations with Ansible and Ansible Automation Platform
* Day 1 and Day 2 operations: what's the difference?
* The IT Value Stream and how you can exploit it to accelerate your automation practice
* AI and the future of technology: Brad's opinion (hint: it's only software)
