I'm Brad Krumme, and I've spent over 2 decades in the world of IT infrastructure and Operations. As a Solution Architect at Red Hat, I'm all about finding smart ways to solve problems and make life easier through technology. I'm passionate about automation and process improvement, and I love working with tools like Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, and more.  I lean into concepts such as Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code, and have started exploring the capabilities of AI.  With certifications like Red Hat Certified Architect and AWS Certified Practitioner under my belt, I've picked up a thing or two over the years and can't wait to share what I've learned with you here.

Prior to joining Red Hat, I worked on IT infrastructure and operations teams across the healthcare and insurance industries, with a short stint in the travel industry.  My primary role was a Linux Systems Administrator, however I also contributed to Web Hosting, Enterprise Architecture, IT Automation, Confuration Management, Compliance and Governance, Identity and Access Management, IT Service Management, and more.  The Red Hat ecosystem was prevalent throughout each of my roles.  While I truly enjoyed what I did and the company I worked at, I had to sieze the opportunity to join Red Hat when it presented itself.  I thought to myself that it would be AWESOME to work for the company that has contributed so much to my success.  On June 17, 2019 I arrived at Red Hat Tower in Raleigh for my first day of New Hire Orientation.

In the 6 years since joining Red Hat, I've served multiple roles, all customer-facing in pre-sales.  I started as an Account Solution Architect, a general technologist focusing on the overall journey of the customers I interacted with, helping them with everything from Server Infrastructure to Application Hosting to Automation, and any other use case Red Hat was able to assist with.  For a short time in the second half of 2021, I specialized in what I thought was my passion...Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  Then, starting in January of 2022, I took on my first big challenge, specializing in multiple products simultaneously.  For the entire year, my focus was on both OpenShift Container Platform ***AND*** Ansible Automation Platform.  In 2023, that changed to the role I maintain today and what I currently believe is my passion, Enterprise Automation with Ansible Automation Platform.

I'm glad you're here!
