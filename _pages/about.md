I'm Brad Krumme, and I've spent over 20 years in the world of IT infrastructure and Operations. As a Solution Architect at Red Hat, I'm all about finding smart ways to solve problems and make life easier through technology. I'm passionate about automation and process improvement, and I love working with tools like Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, and more.  I lean into concepts such as Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code, and have started exploring the capabilities of AI.  With certifications like Red Hat Certified Architect and AWS Certified Practitioner under my belt, I've picked up a thing or two over the years and can't wait to share what I've learned with you here.
